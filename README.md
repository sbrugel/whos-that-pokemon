# Who's that Pokemon?
A game made in React based on the segment of the same name in the Pokemon anime. Currently, There are over 800 Pokemon to choose from, consisting of all of Gen 1-7 and most of Gen 8.

**NOTE**: If on mobile, the game only works on Landscape orientation. I might add support for Portrait later, but I am busy and lazy.
